In other words, human knowledge is fallible (that is, liable to fail).  Later, the author writes, 'First-person introspection, the act of a person scanning his or her own brain to see what going on in there, might not be as unquestionable as once thought.' This indicates that our uncertainty ought to cover fields which we recently were quite certain of.  Answer A is a tad extreme.  Answer C is partially correct: the passage argues that our second order thinking is imperfect. However, the second part isn't supported in the passage. The author writes, 'No one can really say whether or not their first order thinking.' This is not a resounding testimony in favor of first order thinking.  Answer D takes things a bit too far.
